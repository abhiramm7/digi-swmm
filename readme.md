# EWRI-WDSA Webinar: Digi-SWMM
## üåßÔ∏èüêç Building the Next Generation of Storm Water Systems Using Python üêç‚õàÔ∏è

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks for the EWRI-WDSA webinar on modeling stormwater systems using Python.

### Getting Started

We will use Google Colab for executing these notebooks. You should be signed into Google to access the Colab notebook. Click on the link below to familiarize yourself with the simulation environment we will be using in the webinar.

**Simulation Environment**: [Simulation Environment](https://colab.research.google.com/github/abhiramm7/digi-swmm/blob/main/getting_started.ipynb)
